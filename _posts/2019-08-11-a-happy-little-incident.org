A little happy incident that happened recently was that I was a snippet of a kdrama and mistook which drama it was from. Funnily enough, I ended up watching a kdrama which had the complete opposite premise than the one I saw in the snippet (of course, I finished both of them in the end). Also, I sort of rushed this post in a couple of minutes, so expect many edits!

The snippet I saw was from a kdrama called "Touching You". It is a romantic comedy about a man who can see the future by coming into skin contact and ends up in a tangled fate with a kind woman referred to as an 'angel'. I saw part of the first episode, in which the man uses his powers along with his charm to cop a good deal. I was intrigued by how well controlled his power was, which is rare in most shows (kdrama or not).

The kdrama I watched by accident is "He is Psychometric". It is about boy who is able to read the past by coming into contact. By the first episode, I had determined that he had absolutely no clue how to harness his power, but the plot was /amazing/. I was hooked by what I was shown.

I tend to enjoy shows with intellectuals going against one another, and this show ended up being even better than I had hoped for. With so many secrets and plot revealed by the past, the show definitely took an interesting turn. I also grew a deeper understanding for how

the past may not define us, but it can unlock our futures. We must live without regret, and if we do have regret, we must resolve it rather than wallow in it.

This quote... isn't actually by anyone. It's just a lesson I learned and phrased. I remember reading "Great Expectations" by Charles Dickens, and there was a character trapped in the past. It was sad in my opinion, but also a realistic scenario if generalized (I'm not here to ruin the book, so not too much about it!). I strongly feel that sometimes we focus on the past and end up wasting our time focusing on the wrong things. 'What ifs' are infinite, it's no use thinking about those. You sometimes have to accept the past as is. Good thing "He is Psychometric" questioned /what the past is/ though.

All and all, I'd recommend watching "Touching You" for a super short and light-heart comedy, and  "He is Psychometric" for something a bit more serious.
