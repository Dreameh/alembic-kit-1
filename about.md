### Khinshan Khan (@kkhan01)

This is probably the hardest part of the entire site... probably even harder than the anticipated
dry periods of blogging. I have no idea how many people this website will reach, but I'll try to
describe myself in such a manner that one would need to have met me in real life to realize I'm
somewhat of a cool cat {% include emoji/CatKool.html %}

I'm an undergraduate computer science student and a StuyCS alumnus (mentioned because I seem to meet
a lot of alums... and Stuyvesant was an Emacs recruiting ground).
