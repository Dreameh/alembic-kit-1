### Khinshan Khan (@kkhan01)

This is probably the hardest part of the entire site... probably even harder than the anticipated
dry periods of blogging. I have no idea how many people this website will reach, but I'll try to
describe myself in such a manner that one would not need to have met me in real life to realize I'm
somewhat of a cool cat {% include emoji/CatKool.html %}

My name is Khinshan Khan, but feel free to call me Shan or any other nickname that makes sense (go
ahead and throw new nicknames or scavenge for my other ones). I currently live in New York City, New
York. I'm an undergraduate computer science student and a StuyCS alumnus (mentioned because I seem to
meet a lot of alums... and Stuyvesant was an Emacs recruiting ground).

I don't particularly specialize in any areas ( *yet?* ) since I've always felt becoming
a full stack developer is sort of the only path carved out of me (ironically so) due to my curiosity
and passion to learn. However, I am willing to nerd out about a couple of topics... especially emacs.

My key programming language languages are Python, C++, OCaml, Lisp (ELisp, SBCL).
